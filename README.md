# EXIT
EXIT is a small escape room game, crammed with a ton of custom programmed features. These features are designed to easily support puzzles, combat, an inventory, item crafting and much more. Designed alongside with this project are several custom toolsets and dozens of reusable flexible components, making it a sort of personal framework. As this framework was designed to be used in future projects of mine, many features exist that aren't used in EXIT, but can be viewed in the code repository.

EXIT uses the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP).

Highlights:

* A rich set of features to support most first person games.
* Use of Unity Cinemachine and Timeline for cutscenes.
* Designer friendly custom toolsets allow creating puzzles, items, crafting combos and events quickly and easily.
* Inheritance and Interfaces are used for a solid foundation for interactable objects and puzzles.
* Core gameplay system decoupled via Delegates and Events.
* Most components allow the designer to fire off UnityEvents for flexibility.
